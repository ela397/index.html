SECTION 3<br> <br><br>ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION<br>
<br><i> Key ideas</i><br>
<br> • Number Patterns: These are sequences or patterns that help in recognising 
relationships and predicting outcomes. For example, recognising that the 
sequence 2, 4, 6, 8 follows a pattern of increasing by 2.<br>
<br> • Variables: These are unknown quantities that are represented by letters 
or symbols.<br> 
<br>• Factorisation of algebraic expressions: Algebraic expressions can be 
broken down into factors. <br><br>For example,<br> <br>x2 – 4 <br><br>can be factorised as<br> 
<br>(x – 2) 
(x + 2). <br>
<br>• A perfect square is an expression that can be written in the form  (x)   2 or  
x  2, where x is a variable or an expression. <br><br>For example, 4, 9, and 16 are 
perfect squares because they can be written as<br>  2  2 ,  3  2 , and  4  2 respectively.
<br> • The difference of two squares formula is:  a  2 −  b  2 =  (  a + b )  (  a − b ) .<br> <br>This 
formula can be used to factorise expressions like  x  2  − 4 or 9 −  y  2.<br>
<br> • Algebraic Fractions: An algebraic fraction is an expression in the 
form  a __ b  , where a and b are algebraic expressions. To perform operations 
on algebraic fractions, we can follow these rules:<br>
<br> • An algebraic fraction is zero if the numerator (a) is zero, and it is undefined 
if the denominator (b) is zero.<br>
<br> NUMBER PATTERNS, ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 
AND ITS OPERATIONS<br>
<br> Number patterns are sequences of numbers that follow a certain rule or formula. 
These patterns can be found all around us, from the natural world to man-made 
structures. Understanding number patterns helps us make predictions, solve 
problems, and uncover the underlying order in seemingly random sets of numbers.
 Let us take a look at some examples of patterns in real life.
<img src="./math_files/img.jpg" alt"image"="">
                              
<br><br>
 From the pictures below, we realise that patterns can be found in all aspect of our 
lives. From our clothes, home decorations, building designs and even animals 
on both land and sea, we see various beautiful patterns. Can you identify some 
patterns around you? Share with a friend.<br>
<br> 3<br>
<br>SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION<br>
</p><p> In Junior High School, we also learnt about patterns from shapes and numbers.</p>
<img ="c:\users\user\desktop\circle.jpg"="" alt="image">
 <br>
Let us take a look at some examples.<br>
<p> Take a look at the pattern above, it is made up of circles. Can you determine how 
each successive group of circles came about?</p><p> We realise that each next pattern 
is generated by adding the next counting number to the preceding pattern, right? 
But assuming we are to determine the number of circles in the 100th term. Could 
that be easy?</p> I’m sure you agree with me that it will be a challenging task. So, we 
will need to find a smart way to do that. This brings us to the need to find the rule 
or nth term rule. This will help us to be able to find any term in any given pattern. 
Now in this lesson our focus will be on writing algebraic expressions for the rules 
of the patterns that we will explore. Then in SHS 2 we will turn our attention to 
exploring patterns and sequences including arithmetic and geometric patterns.
<br> Dear <br>
<p> Now that we have explored Number Patterns, Algebraic Expressions, and their 
Operations, let’s apply what we’ve learned through a series of engaging activities. 
Please follow the instructions below for each activity.</p>
<br> 4<br>
<br>SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION<br>
<br> Activity 1 <br>
<p>Let’s look at this pattern:</p>
 <br>Pattern: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...<br>
<p> Materials: Bottle tops.</p>
<br> Rule:<br>
 <br>• Use bottle tops to create the above pattern.<br>
 <br>• We start with 2 bottle tops.<br>
 <br>• Each time, we add 3 bottle tops. This means that to go from ‘term to 
term’ to find the next term we + 3<br>
<br> Algebraic Expression: Let  a↓n
   represent nth term in the pattern where ↓ represent "base". The expression 
can be written as:<br>
 <p>a↓ n</p>
<p>  = 3n − 1 </p>
<brwhere n="" is="" the="" position="" of="" term="" in="" pattern.="" hence,="" algebraic="" expression="" 3n="" −="" 1.<="" br="">

<br> Activity 2<br>
<p> Fig.1</p>
<img =="" "c:\users\user\desktop\app\box.jpg"="" alt="image">
<p> From the pattern, we realise that,
 The pattern below is made up of squares, made from lines, as shown below. 
Investigate the pattern, find the nth term rule and write an algebraic expression 
for the number of lines required to make the pattern, if the pattern continues.</p>

 From the table let represent each term with n . Now, if we multiply n by 3 and 
add 1 we obtain the number of lines needed to create the shape in each term. 
Therefore, our rule for the pattern is  a  n
  = 3n + 1 . Remember,  3n + 1  is an 
algebraic expression.

 Activity 3
 Ama is collecting seashells on the beach. On her first day, she collected 1 
seashell. Each day after that she collected 2 more seashells than the previous 
day. How many seashells will she have on the fifth day? Let’s generate a 
pattern from the above and use it to formulate mathematical expression.
 Step 1: Identify the pattern
 Day 1: 1 seashell
 Day 2: 1 + 2 = 3 seashells
 Day 3: 3 + 2 = 5 seashells
 Day 4: 5 + 2 = 7 seashells
 Day 5: 7 + 2 = 9 seashells
 Step 2: Formulate the mathematical expression
 The pattern shows that each day, the number of seashells increases by 2. 
Therefore, the mathematical expression is:
 S = 1 + 2 (n – 1) = 1 + 2n − 2 = 2n − 1 
where S is the total number of seashells and n is the day number.
 Step 3: Use the expression to find the number of seashells on the fifth day
 Substitute  n = 5  into the expression:
 S = 2(5) – 1
 S = 10 – 1
 S = 9
 Therefore, Ama will have 9 seashells on the fifth day.
 Have you ever heard of the term “Algebraic expression”? if you do that’s very 
good, if you do not let’s now look at the meaning of Algebraic expression. 
An Algebraic expression in mathematics is an expression which is made 
up of variables, constants and arithmetic operations. (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division) Some examples include: 
3x – 5  ,  n + 8,  x  2, 2 x  2 + 3x – 5  and  2x + 5xy + 3.

 Rules for the Use of the Operations of Algebraic 
Expression
 2. Addition and Subtraction 
In algebra, you can only add or subtract like terms, example  3x + 5x = 8x, 
2y – 5y = − 3y ,   7a + 5b = 7a + 5b  
i. 
Like terms: Two or more terms are like terms if they have the same variables 
with the same exponent irrespective of their numerical coefficients. They 
can be added or subtracted to get a single term. For example:  3 x  2  and  7 x  2 , 
4xy  and  2xy, 5 a  3 b  and  − 7 a  3 b 
ii.  
Unlike terms: are terms that cannot be added or subtracted in an expression 
to get a single term. Example:  3 x  2  and  a  2, 5y  and  4xy 
3. Multiplication and Division
 Both like terms as well as unlike terms can be multiplied and divided. In multiplying, 
we make use of distributive property depending on the expression given. To divide, 
look for factors that are common to both numerator and denominator and this can 
8
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 be divided or cancelled. Factors that are common to all terms of an expression 
can be factored out.

Activity 4
 Expand  (  2x + 3 )  (  x – 4 )  
Step 1: Multiply the two binomials using the distributive property:
 (  2x + 3 )  (  x – 4 )  = 2x (  x )  – 2x (  4 )  + 3 (  x )  – 3 (  4 )  
Step 2: Multiply the terms:
 2x ×  (  x )  = 2 x  2 
2x ×  (  − 4 )  = − 8x 
3 ×  (  x )  = 3x 
3 (  − 4 )  = − 12 
Step 3: Combine like terms:
 2 x  2 – 8x + 3x – 12 
9
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Step 4: Simplify the expression by combining like terms:
 2 x  2 – 5x – 12 
Therefore, the expanded form of  (  2x + 3 )  (  x – 4 )  is 2 x  2 – 5x – 12 
We’ve explored number patterns, learned how to identify and describe the rules 
that govern them and also how to formulate algebraic expression from the number 
patterns. Let’s now look at factorisation of algebraic expressions.
 FACTORISATION OF ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 
In factorising algebraic expressions, we look for like terms, group them and find 
common factors. Factorising is the reverse process of expanding brackets in 
algebraic expressions. Algebraic expressions could be factorised in many ways 
depending on the given expression(s) and it includes the common factor approach, 
algebraic tiles, regrouping of terms approach, standard identity approach, splitting
the-middle-term approach and using the quadratic formula. For instance;
 Factorising
 3x + 6  3(x + 2)
 Expanding brackets
 Worked Examples
 Factorise the following 
1.   
2.   
4x + 4by
 ac + bc + ad + bd  
Solutions
 1. Look for the common factor(s) 
Factorising
 x2 + 6x + 5  (x + 5)(x + 1)
 Expanding brackets
 Factor the common term out (Highest common factor) 
4x +  4by = 4 (  x + by )   
2. First put the four terms in the expression into two groups of two and find the 
common factors from each. i.e.,  (ac + bc) +  (ad + bd) = c (  a + b )  + d (  a + b ) 
and add the outside terms and take one of the common terms to be the final 
answer.  (a+ b) (  c + d ) .

SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 There are many ways to factorise algebraic expressions. Factorisation is an 
important skill in algebra that helps us solve equations. We’ll look at different 
methods to factorise expressions, and each method is useful in different situations. 
By learning these methods, you’ll become good at factorising expressions and 
solving equations.
 Factorising and Solving Equations Using Algebraic 
Tiles 
Activity 5

 Solution 
Step 1 
Let’s represent the equation with our algebraic tiles
 Step 2: 
Step 3:
 Transpose -2 by adding 2 to both sides (yellow squares are positive while red 
squares are negative numbers)
 11
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 I hope you understand factorisation by using algebraic tiles, Let’s explore another 
method of factorisation, called Factorisation by Regrouping of Terms.
 Factorisation by Regrouping of Terms Approach
 In some algebraic expressions, not every term may have a common factor. For 
instance, consider the algebraic expression,  12a + n – na –12.  The terms of this 
expression do not have a particular factor in common but the first and last term 
has a common factor of ‘12’. Similarly, the second and third terms have n as a 
common factor. So, the terms can be regrouped as:
 ⇒  12a + n – na – 12 = 12a – 12 + n – an
 ⇒  12a – 12 – an + n = 12 (  a – 1 )  –n (  a – 1 ) 
After regrouping, it can be seen that  (  a − 1 )   is a common factor in each term,
 ⇒  12a + n – na – 12 =  (  a – 1 )   (  12 – n ) 
Thus, by regrouping terms we can factorise algebraic expressions.
 Let’s now engage in an activity using the factorisation by regrouping of terms 
approach:
 Activity 6
 Example: Factorise the expression:  x  2 + 5x + 6 
Follow these steps below:
 Steps:
 Step 1: Write down the expression:  x  2 + 5x + 6 
Step 2: Look for two numbers whose product is 6 (the constant term) and 
whose sum is 5 (the coefficient of the linear (or x) term). These numbers are 
2 and 3.
 Step 3: Rewrite the expression by regrouping the terms:  x  2 + 2x + 3x + 6 
Step 4: Factor out the common term from each group:  x (  x + 2 )  + 3 (  x + 2 )  
Step 5: Factor out the common binomial term:  (  x + 3 )  (  x + 2 )  
Therefore, the factorised form of the expression is  (  x + 3 )  (  x + 2 )  . 
I hope you’re familiar with factorisation through regrouping terms. Now, let’s dive 
into another exciting method: factorising expressions using standard identities. 
12
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Factorising expressions using standard identities
 An equality relation is one which holds true for all the values of variables in 
mathematics. It is known as an identity and has this sign,  ≡ ,  rather than the 
standard = sign. Consider the following identities:
 (a + b)   2 ≡  a  2 +  b  2 + 2ab 
(a − b)   2 ≡  a  2 +  b  2 − 2ab 
a  2 −  b  2 ≡  (a + b) (  a − b )  
On substituting any value of  a  and  b , both sides of the given equations remain the 
same. Therefore, these equations are called identities.
 Hello learner! Let’s engage in this activity by applying some standard identities 
which suits our example.
 Activity 7
 Example:  x  2 − 4 
Follow these steps of Activities
 Step 1: Identify the Expression:
 Given the expression  x  2 − 4 
Step 2: Recognise the Pattern:
 The expression fits the pattern of the difference of two squares:  a  2 −  b  2 
Step 3: Rewrite the Expression:
 Rewrite 4 as  2  2  so the expression becomes  x  2 −  2  2 
Step 4: Apply the Identity:
 • Here,  a = x, b = 2 
• Using the identity  a  2 −  b  2 ≡  (a + b) (a − b) 
Step 5: Simplify and Combine:
 Apply the identity:  x  2 −  2  2 ≡  (x + 2) (  x − 2 )  
Thus, the factorised form of  x  2 − 4  is  (x + 2) (  x − 2 )

SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Rectangle
 A rectangle is a quadrilateral with opposite pair of sides equal
 The side AB = DC = Length(L)
 The side BC = AD = Width(W)
 The opposite sides are parallel and equal
 Area of a rectangle =  Length (  L )  × Width (  W )  
Area of a rectangle =  L × W 
Note that area is expressed in square units
 Let’s try these two examples on area of a rectangle
 Example 2 
Solution 
Example 3 
The length of a rectangle is 4 cm and its width (breadth) is 3 cm. Find its area.
 Area of a rectangle = Length × Width 
=  4 cm × 3 cm = 12 cm² 
Therefore, the area of the rectangle is  12 cm  2 
The picture below is Mr. Bluba’s rectangular 
garden, where he grows cabbage and Kontomire, 
measures 8m in length and 3m in width. What is 
the total area of the garden?
 Solution
 Area of the garden = Length of the garden × Width of the garden 
=  8m × 3 m = 24m² 
Thus, the area of the rectangular garden is  24m²

SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Think of it like this! If you have a room with a length of 10 feet and a width of 5 
feet, the area would be 10 x 5 = 50 square feet. That’s the amount of space you’d 
need to cover with flooring, paint, or carpet!
 Now that we’ve learned about the area of a rectangle, let’s use this knowledge to 
explore how to factorise quadratic trinomials using algebraic tiles.
 Factorise Quadratic Trinomials Using Algebraic 
Tiles 
Example 4 
Factorise  x  2 + 7x + 12  using algebraic tiles
 Solution
 Use algebraic tiles
 Let’s undertake this activity on how to factorise quadratic trinomials using 
algebraic tiles
 Activity 8
 Let’s factorise  x  2 + x− 6  using trinomial algebraic tiles:
 Step 1: Represent the expression as tiles:
 x  2  =  (  x × x )  
x = (1 × x)– 6 = (– 6 × 1)
 15
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Step 2: Arrange the tiles to form a rectangle:
 (  x × x )  +  (  3 × x )  +  (  − 2 × x )  +  (  − 6 × 1 )  
Step 3: Identify the common factors:
 (  x × x )  +  (  3 × x )  = x (  x + 3 )  
(  − 2 × x )  +  (  − 6 × 1 )  = − 2 (  x + 3 )  
Step 4: Combine the factors:
 x (  x + 3 )  – 2 (  x + 3 )  
Step 5: Factor out the common binomial term:
 (  x – 2 )  (  x + 3 )  
Example 5 
Factorising Quadratic Trinomials Using the 
Standard Identities 
Factorise  x  2 + 6x + 9
 Solution
 x  2 + 6x + 9 = 0  
The identity is a  2 + 2ab + b  2 ≡  (a + b)   2 
The LHS is of the form  a  2 + 2ab +  b  2, 
⇒  (x + 3)   2
 Or  (  x + 3 )   (  x + 3 )  
Factors are  (  x + 3 )   and  (  x + 3 )  
Let’s now look at how to factorise using quadratic equations using formula 
approach.
 16
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Factorising Quadratic Equation Using Formula 
Approach 
This method is very similar to the method of splitting the middle term.
 Step 1: Consider the quadratic equation   ax  2 + bx + c = 0
 Step 2: Now, find two numbers such that their product is equal to ac and sum 
equals to b. 
(  number 1 )   (  number 2 )  = ac 
(  number 1 )  +  (  number 2 )  = b  
Step 3: Substitute these two numbers in the formula given below:
 (  1 / a )   [  ax +  (  number 1 )  ]   [  ax +  (  number 2 )  ]  = 0  
Step 4: Finally simplify the equation
 Example 6 
Solve  3 x  2 + 7x + 4 = 0
 Follow the steps carefully 
Solution
 3 x  2 + 7x + 4 = 0 
Here,  a = 3, b = 7, c = 4 
ac =  (  3 )  (  4 )  = 12  
Let’s identify two numbers such that their sum is 7 and the product is 12. 
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 
Sum of two factors = 7 
Product of those two factors = 12
 Number 1 = 3 and number 2
 Now, substitute these two numbers in the formula (1/a) [ax + (number 1)] [ax + 
(number 2)] = 0. 
( 1 __ 
3
 ) (3x + 3) (3x + 4) = 0  
(  3x + 3 )   (  3x + 4 )  = 0 
1 __
 3× 3  (  x + 1 )   (  3x + 4 )  = 0
 (  x + 1 )  (  3x + 4 )  = 0 
Thus,  (  x + 1 )   and  (  3x + 4 )   are the factors of the given quadratic equation.
 17
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Learners, now that we’ve mastered factoring quadratic equation using the formula 
approach. Let’s explore another fascinating method of factorisation of quadratic 
equation by splitting the middle term
 Get ready to dive into this exciting new technique. 
Factorisation of Quadratic Equations by Splitting 
the Middle Term
 Step 1: Consider the quadratic equation  a x  2 + bx + c = 0
 Step 2: Now, find two numbers such that their product is equal to  ac  and sum 
equals to  b. 
(number 1) (number 2) = ac 
(  number 1 )  +  (  number 2 )  = b 
Step 3: Now, split the middle term using these two numbers, 
a x  2 +  (  number 1 )  x +  (  number 2 )  x + c = 0   
Step 4: Take the common factors out and simplify. 
Let’s have a look at the example problem given below: 
Example 7 
Factorise and then solve the quadratic equation   x  2 + 7x + 10 = 0  by splitting the 
middle term
 Given,  x  2 + 7x + 10 = 0 
Here,  a = 1, b = 7, c = 10  
ac =  (  1 )   (  10 )  = 10  
Factors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
 Let’s identify two of these factors such that their sum is 7 and their product is 10.
 Sum of two factors = 7 = 2 + 5 
Product of these two factors = (2)(5) = 10
 Now, split the middle term. 
x  2 + 2x + 5x + 10 = 0  
Take the common terms and simplify. 
x (  x + 2 )  + 5 (  x + 2 )  = 0  
(  x + 5 )  (  x + 2 )  = 0  
18
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Thus,  (  x + 2 )   and  (  x + 5 )   are the factors of the given quadratic equation.

 PERFECT SQUARES
 Can you think of integers that can be expressed as the square of another integer? I 
hope you have written numbers such as  1 =  1   2 , 4 =  2   2 , 16 =  4   2   and many others. 
These numbers; 1, 4, 16, ... are what we call ‘Perfect Squares’. How would you 
describe ‘perfect squares’ in your own words?
 What are Perfect Squares?
 A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the square of another integer. 
E.g. 4 is a perfect square of 2, because it can be expressed as 22 =  2 × 2 = 4. Other 
examples such as 1, 9, and 16 are perfect squares because they can be written as   
1   2 ,  3   2   and   4   2  respectively.
 It is important to note the following;
 • any number that cannot be expressed as the square of another number 
(integer) is not a perfect square. For example; 2 is not a perfect square 
because it cannot be expressed as the square of another integer.
 • negative numbers are not considered as perfect squares. This is because 
negative numbers cannot be expressed as the square of another integer. For 
example,  − 49 ≠  7   2  or   (− 7)    2  
Let us go through the activity below on how to generate some perfect squares by 
adding consecutive odd numbers. 
Activity 10
 List the first 5 consecutive odd numbers.
 Add consecutive odd numbers to generate perfect squares
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10…
 1 =1 = 12
 1 + 3 = 4 = 22
 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 32
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 42
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 = 52 
1 hope you have observed the pattern and can follow through to generate more of 
these perfect squares. Write them down and compare it to that of your friend(s).

differences. Very Good! 
However, discuss your observations on the following with a classmate;-  -  -  
How does the area of the larger square change as the side length increases?
 Can you predict the area of a larger square based on its side length?
 What is the pattern between the perfect squares and their areas? 
21
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Let us now investigate the difference between two perfect squares. I hope you 
have an idea. 
Perfect squares can be used to illustrate the concept of difference of two squares. 
Here’s how to go about it:
 Activity 12
 Let’s consider two perfect squares, say:
 a  2 = a × a   (a squared)
 b  2 = b × b  (b squared)
 Now, let’s find the difference between these two squares:
 a  2 −  b  2 
We can rewrite this expression as:
 (a × a) - (b × b)
 Next, we can factorise the expression by grouping the terms:
 (a × a) - (b × b) = (a + b)(a - b)
 Very Good! We’ve arrived at the difference of two squares formula:
 a  2 −  b  2 =  (a + b) (a − b) 
This formula shows that the difference between two squares can be factorised into 
the sum and difference of the same two terms. This can be a powerful tool for 
simplifying and evaluating expressions and solving equations.

SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 We already know that to find the area of square = side(s) × side(s)
 Mathematically, Area of a Square =  s  2 
1. Fig. 1 above shows a square of side a and its Area=  a × a =  a  2 
a2 is the perfect square of a
 2. Fig. 2 shows the result of taking a square of side b from one of the four 
corners of Fig. 1.
 The result from Fig. 2 gives Fig. 3.
 The Area of Fig. 3 = Area of region I + Area of region II
 ((a -b) × b)+(a × (a-b)) = a  2 −  b  2 
Area of Fig. 4 (a+b) (a-b) = Length x breadth
 Area of Fig. 3 = area of Fig. 4
 (a + b) (a - b) = a2 – b2
 Below is a pictorial representation on how to expand difference of two squares.
 For example,  x  2 − 4  ,  y  2 − 1,  a  2 −  b  2 etc
 x2 – 4 = (x +2)(x -2) , y2 - 1 = (y -1)(y + 1), a2- b2= (a-b)(a+b)
 NOTE: Anytime there is a binomial with each term being squared (i.e. having an 
exponent of 2) and subtraction (minus) as the middle sign then you are guaranteed 
to have the case of difference of two square.
 Again, the exponents of each term must be a multiple of two (2) and the coefficients 
should be a perfect square. 
Caution: In the sum of two squares, it is not possible to factor a sum of two 
squares using real numbers. 
Thus;  x  2 + 9 ≠  (  x + 3 )  (  x + 3 )    or  (  x − 3 )  (  x + 3 )  
May I take you back to the previous lesson on expansion of binomials and consider 
the product, 
(  a + b )  (  a − b ) .
 23
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Using the distributive property to expand gives us;
 (a + b) (a − b) = a (a − b) + b (  a − b )  
=  a  2 − ab + ab −  b  2 
=  a  2 −  b  2 
⇒  (a + b) (a − b) =  a  2 −  b  2 
Let us now explore how to factorise difference of two squares.
 Example 8 
Factorise  x  2 − 49 
Solution
 Since the first term ( x  2 ) has already been expressed as a perfect square, express 49 
as a square of another number and that is  7 × 7 =  7  2 
x  2 − 49 =  x  2 −  7  2 
=  (  x + 7 )  (  x − 7 )  
Example 9
 Factorise  25 a  2 − 16 
Solution
 25a2 − 16 = 52a2 − 42
 =  5(a)2 − 42 
=  (  5a − 4 )  (  5a + a )  
Example 10
 Factorise completely  p  4 − 81 q  4 
Solution
 p  4 − 81 q  4 =  ( p  2 )   2 −  9  2 ( q  2 )   2 
=  ( p  2 )   2 −  (9 q  2 )   2 
=  (  p  2 − 9 q  2 )  (  p  2 + 9 q  2 )  
I hope you have observed that  (  p  2 − 9 q  2 )   is also a difference of two squares and 
can be factorised as well. You can proceed to factorise the expression as this;
 ⟹  ( p  2 −  3  2 q  2 ) ( p  2 + 9 q  2 ) 
24
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 =  (  p − 3 )  (  p + 3 )  ( p  2 + 9 q  2 ) 
Therefore,  p  4 − 81 q  4 =  (  p − 3 )  (  p + 3 )  ( p  2 + 9 q  2 ) 
Can you now try this example?
 Example 11
 Factorise the expression   (  m  2 −  n  2 )  − k (  m + n )  completely 
Solution
 Since  m  2 −  n  2  is a difference of two squares,
 ⟹  (  m  2 −  n  2 )  − k (  m + n )  =  (  m − n )  (  m + n )  − k (  m + n )  
It can also be observed that  m + n  is common to both terms so we can factorise 
it out as;
 =  (  m + n )  ( (  m − n )  − k) 
=  (  m + n )  ( (  m − n − k) 
Let us now apply the concept of the difference of two squares in solving real life 
problems.
 Example 12
 If the length of a rectangular mirror is (x + 2) units and the width is (x - 2) units, 
f
 ind the area of the mirror?
 Solution
 Area of a rectangle   = L × B 
=  (x + 2) ×  (  x − 2 )  
=  (  x  2 − 4 )  square units 
Example 13
 Without using calculator, evaluate  21  2 −  11  2 completely.
 Solution
 21  2 −  11  2 =  (  21 − 11 )  (  21 + 11 )  
= (10)(32) 
= 320 
25
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Example 14
 Without using calculator, evaluate  9R + 48 = 75  hence, find the value(s) of R
 Solution
 9R = 75 − 48
 9R = 3 (  25 − 16 )  
9R = 3 (  5  2 −  4  2 )  
_
 9R = 3 (  5 − 4 )  (  5 + 4 )  
9R = 3 (  1 )  (  9 )  
9R 
9 = 27 _ 9  
R = 3 
Do look for more examples, try your hands on them together with your classmates 
and compare your answers.
 I hope we are making positive progress. Very Good! 
Let us now consider how to operate on fractions that contain variable(s) either as 
the numerator or denominator or even both.

 Work through the following examples with a classmate to make sure you fully 
understand what is happening. 
Example 17
 Simplify     10 ____ x − 4   + 2 ____ x + 1 as a single fraction. 
Solution
 To express   10 ____ x − 4   + 2 ____ x + 1     as a single fraction, we need to find a common denominator. 
Here are some steps to guide you;
 Step 1: Identify the denominators of the two fractions:  x − 4  and  x + 1.
 Step 2: Find the LCM of  x − 4  and  x + 1 . To do this, we need to find the LCM 
of the two expressions by multiplying both expressions together because they do 
not have common factors:
 LCM =  (x − 4)  (x + 1)  which can also be expressed as  x   2 − 3x – 4 
Step 3: Rewrite each fraction with the LCM as the denominator:
 10 ____ x − 4 =     10(x + 1) __________ (x − 4) (x + 1)  =     10x + 10 __________ (x − 4)(x + 1) 
 2 ____ x + 1 = 2 × (x − 4) __________ (x + 1) (x − 4)  = 2x − 8 __________  (x − 4)  (x + 1)  
Step 4: Add the two fractions:
 10x + 10 __________ (x − 4)(x + 1)   +     2x − 8 __________ (x − 4) (x + 1)  = 10x + 10 + 2x − 8  _____________  (x − 4) (x + 1)  
Step 5: Simplify the fraction, if possible:
 Simplifying this gives us;   12x + 2 __________  (x − 4)  (x + 1)  
So, the final answer is:
 10 _____ x − 4  + 2 ____ x + 1 = 12x + 2 __________  (x − 4)  (x + 1)  or 12x + 2 ________ x2− 3x − 4

Can you also recall how to multiply or divide ordinary fractions? Good. 
Multiplication and division of algebraic fractions are also done in the same 
manner. 
So, let us now look at how to multiply or divide Algebraic Fractions with monomial 
or binomial denominators.
 Multiplication and Division of Algebraic Fractions
 When multiplying algebraic fractions, first of all check whether there are common 
factors, cancel them out and when there are none, multiply the numerators and the 
denominators separately. For example;    m 
__ 
n×  a __ b  =  m × a 
_____ 
n × b  =  ma 
___ 
nb  
Also, when an algebraic fraction is divided by another, multiply the first fraction 
by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Thus  m 
_
 n÷ a _ b  = m _ n  × b _ a  = mb 
_
 na  etc.
 Note: Always ensure that you leave your answer in its simplest form.

 ⇒   6x + 8 _____ 4 ÷    x   2  + 3 _____ 5 x   2  =  15x   3  + 20 x   2  _________ 2 x   2  + 6 
Example 22
 Simplify  2 m   2  ___ 3 ÷   4m ___ 9 
Solution
   2 m   2  _ 3   ÷ 4m _ 9   
Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction
 ⇒ 2 m   2  _ 3   ×  9 _ 4m   
Cancel out those with common factors or multiply the numerators separately and 
the denominators also separately. Note, you can only cancel opposite numerators 
and denominators when we are at the multiplication stage, not while it is still in 
the division stage.
 ⇒   18 m   2  ____ 12m    , here 6m divides both the numerator and the denominator to reduce it to;
 3m ___ 2 
 ⇒ 2 m   2  _ 3   ÷ 4m _ 9   = 3m _ 2   
I encourage you to try your hands on more examples with your classmates and 
compare your answers.
 Does it make sense when asked to divide an object into zero (0) equal parts and 
share it among a number of people? Obviously no!
 What about dividing an object into equal number of parts and sharing them among 
nobody? Does this make a meaning? Of course, Yes!
 This implies that when a number is divided by zero (0), we say the fraction is not 
defined or it is undefined. Also, when the numerator of a fraction is zero, the 
entire fraction is zero (0).
 Therefore, an Algebraic Expression is said to be undefined or not defined if the 
variable at the denominator assumes a value (takes on a value) that makes the 
denominator zero.
 Zero or Undefined Algebraic fractions
 Algebraic fractions are said to be undefined or have no meaning if the denominator 
is equal to zero. 
For example; the fraction   2 _ x    is said to be undefined when  x = 0 
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Likewise, an algebraic fraction is said to be zero if the numerator is equal to zero.
 Let us do this activity to ascertain why a fraction is said to be undefined or zero.

 Note:
 Dividend 
_ 
Divisor  = Quotient 
⇒ Quotient × Divisor = Dividend 
Therefore, if  16

 2 = 8 
This implies  8 × 2 =16 
Again,  0

 13 = 0 . This implies  13 × 0 = 0 
How would you determine that a fraction is undefined? I hope you have an idea. 
Below are some guidelines that help you

 0≠ 0 , This implies  0 × 0 ≠ 5  (It cannot be defined) 
Have you now seen the reason why we say a fraction is undefined or not defined 
when the denominator is zero? Very well. 
Let us now explore some conditions under which an algebraic fraction is considered 
undefined or zero. 
Conditions Under Which an Algebraic Expression is Said 
to be Zero or Undefined
 To find the value(s) for which an algebraic fraction is undefined, here are some 
steps to guide you.
 Step 1: Equate the denominator of the expression to zero
 Step 2: Solve for the value(s) of the involving variable
 Step 3: The value(s) of the variable makes the expression undefined.
 This implies the variable at the denominator can assume or take all values except 
the value that makes the expression undefined. Let us consider the following 
examples.
 Example 23
 3
 ____ 
Find the value of  x  which makes the expressions undefined:
 i.  
x − 1
 34
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 Solution 
For the expression    3 
____ 
x − 1    to be undefined, the denominator x −1 must be equal to 
zero: x−1=0 Solving for x: 
x = 1
 Therefore, the expression is undefined at x =1
 ii.   
(2x − 1) (x − 4)  
___________ 
4x  2 − 1 
Solution 
For the expression     (2x − 1) (x − 4)  
___________ 
4x  2 − 1   
 to be undefined, the denominator 4x2−1 must be 
equal to zero:
 4x2 − 1 = 0
 This can be factorised as a difference of two squares: 
(2x+1)(2x−1) = 0 
Set each factor to zero: 
2x +1 = 0 or 2x −1= 0 
Solve for x in each case:
 x = − 1 _ 2 or x = 1 _ 2 
Therefore, the expression is undefined at  x = − 1 _ 2
 and x =  1 _ 2
 .
 Also, to find the value(s) for which an algebraic fraction is zero, here are some 
steps to guide you.
 Step 1: Equate the fraction to zero.
 Step 2: Solve for the value(s) of the involving variable.
 Step 3: This value(s) of the variable makes the expression zero and is called the 
zeros of the expression. This means that, when the variable takes that value, the 
outcome of the entire expression is zero.
 Let us consider an example.
 Example 24 
Determine the condition under which  3a _ a − 4  is undefined and determine the 
value of a and do the same for when the whole fraction is zero. 
Condition: a – 4 = 0
 a = 4, Therefore, when a = 4 the fraction is undefined.
 35
SECTION 3 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND FACTORISATION
 _ 
Condition: under which the fraction is zero, put the whole fraction to zero.
 3a 
a − 4 = 0, 3a = 0, a = 0, Therefore, when a is 0 the fraction is zero.
 Example 25
 For what values of  x  is the expression zero.
 Solution
 x  2 + x − 6 
_ 
x  
Equate the fraction to zero
 x  2 + x − 6 
_ 
x  
= 0 
x  2 + x − 6 = 0 
Solve the quadratic
 x  2 + 3x − 2x − 6 = 0 
x (x + 3) − 2 (x + 3) = 0 
(x − 2) (x + 3) = 0 
x − 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0 
x = 2 or x = − 3 
This implies that the expression     x  2 + x − 6 
________ 
x   
 is zero when  x = 2 or x = − 3.
